#XSTD â€“ extension of the C++ standard library

##Description

This library is an extension of the C++ standard library which contains general purpose, commonly used tools.


##Structure

Library root directory contains "include", "src" and "sytem" sub-directories. "Include" directory contains library header files which are supposed to be included in projects. "Src" directory contains project sources with tests and building scripts. "System" directory contains system files used mostly for
library building.

Each library unit is contained in a separate directory. Each unit directory contains "build", "src" and "tests" sub-directories. "Build" directory contains GYP script which is used for building the unit. "Src" directory contains unit source files. "Tests" directory contains unit tests.

##Usage

* Prerequisites.
  + C++11 compatible compiler.
* Using the library.
  + Add path to library "include" directory to your project.
  + Include required unit headers from library "include" directory into your project.
  + Compile your project.

##Testing

* Prerequisites.
  + C++11 compatible compiler supported by GYP.
  + GYP build system.
* Testing library.
  + Set "XSTD_HOME" environment variable to the location of this library. Home directory is one with "src", "include", "system" and others sub-directories
  + Set "GYP_GENERATORS" environment variable to value(s) corresponding you compiler(s). Options should be separated by a comma. Available options are "make", "msvs", "ninja", "scons", "eclipse" and others.
  + Execute library GYP script by calling "gyp --depth=. %LIBRARY_ROOT%/build/generator.gyp" command. Selected build scripts would be produced in the "build" directory.
  + Run build script(s) from "%LIBRARY_ROOT%/build/" directory.
  + Compile test program using selected environment.
  + Run test program.
